# 👋 Hi, I'm Heric Libong!

I'm a passionate Python developer with a background in journalism, now focused on building tools that combine **data**, **APIs**, and **visual storytelling**.  
After 20 years as a journalist, I transitioned into tech to create projects that help **explore, analyze, and narrate the world through code**.
